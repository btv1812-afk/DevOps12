   The Linux System booting stages:
1. BIOS / UEFI:
When the computer powers on, the BIOS or UEFI firmware performs the POST (Power-On Self Test) to check hardware.
Then it finds a bootable device and loads the bootloader from it.
2. MBR (MAster Boot Record):
The first 512 bytes of that device
The bootloader code in the MBR (first stage of GRUB) is loaded into memory.
3. Bootloader (GRUB):
The bootloader (usually GRUB) loads the Linux kernel and the initramfs (temporary filesystem) into memory.
It may also show a menu to choose which OS or kernel to boot.
4. Kernel Initialization:
The kernel takes control, initializes CPU, memory, and hardware drivers.
It mounts the root filesystem and starts the first process (init or systemd).
5. systemd / init Process:
systemd (or init on older systems) starts all system services and background daemons.
It prepares the environment so the system is ready for user login.
6. Runlevel/Target:
The system enters a specific target (multi-user or graphical mode).
This determines whether it boots to a command line or a desktop environment.
7. Login and Shell
The login manager (CLI or GUI) prompts for username and password. CLI stands for command line interface. GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. 
After login, the user’s shell or desktop session starts — and the system is ready to use.
